## 🔱 CodeSentinel

CodeSentinel is a single-file, production-ready secure Python code analyzer and sandbox executor designed to safely inspect and execute untrusted or AI-generated Python code without risking system integrity.

It performs static AST analysis, assigns a risk score, applies heuristic AI probability checks, and runs code inside a time-limited, restricted sandbox before allowing optional full-access execution.

## 🚀 Features
> 🔍 Static Security Analysis

AST-based inspection (no execution required)

Detects:

1)Dangerous module imports (os, subprocess, socket, etc.)
2)Unsafe built-ins (eval, exec, compile, open)
3)High-risk attribute calls (os.system, os.remove, etc.)
4)Line-accurate reporting with code snippets

> 🧮 Risk Scoring System

1)Severity-weighted scoring model
2)Normalized 0–10 risk score
3.Automatically flags high-risk files

> 🤖 AI Heuristic Probability

1)Lightweight heuristic to estimate AI-generated code likelihood
2)Zero external APIs
3)Fully offline and deterministic

> 🧪 Secure Sandbox Execution

1)Runs code in a separate process
2)Enforced execution timeout
3)Restricted built-ins and blocked filesystem access
4)Dangerous imports disabled at runtime
5)Optional manual override for unrestricted execution

> 🪟 Windows-Safe by Design

1)Uses multiprocessing.freeze_support()
2)Compatible with Windows executables and frozen builds

## 📦 Installation

No dependencies required.

git clone https://github.com/LegedsDaD/codesentinel.git
cd codesentinel


Python 3.8+ is required.

## 🔎 Scan a Python file (no execution)
>python codesentinel.py scan example.py


Output includes:

>Detected issues
>Severity levels
>Line numbers and code snippets
>Risk score
>AI probability estimate

 ## ▶️ Run code safely (restricted sandbox)
>python codesentinel.py run example.py


By default:

>Filesystem access is blocked
>Dangerous modules are disabled
>Execution is time-limited

🚨 Run with full system access (dangerous)

If high-risk issues are detected, CodeSentinel requires explicit confirmation:

Type EXACTLY 'I UNDERSTAND' to run UNSAFE mode:


This prevents accidental execution of malicious code.

📊 Example Output
[HIGH] Line 12: Import of dangerous module 'os'
  > import os

[HIGH] Line 25: Dangerous call 'os.remove()'
  > os.remove("important.txt")

🧮 Risk Score: 3/10
🤖 AI-generated probability: 0%

## 🔐 Security Model
>Layer	Protection
>Static Analysis	AST inspection
>Runtime Sandbox	Isolated process
>Built-ins	Whitelisted only
>Imports	Blocked by policy
>Timeout	Forced termination
>Unsafe Mode	Manual confirmation

## ⚠️ Important:
No Python sandbox is perfectly secure. CodeSentinel is designed for risk reduction, not absolute isolation.


## 🧠 Use Cases

1)Reviewing AI-generated Python code
2)Executing code from untrusted sources
3)Teaching Python security concepts
4)Secure local code testing
5)Building higher-level AI agents or coding tools
